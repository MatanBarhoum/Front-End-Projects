# Movie App Site - Written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

<img src="MainDemo.gif">

This project is part of my Front-End learning and part of my Full-Stack learning path. <br>
In this project I used HTML and CSS for the Website and JavaScript to make the grid responsive (Calculating the window.innerWidth / number of grids in a full screen). <br> Further more, JavaScript is being used to iterate with forloop and event into the "click" event when clicking on the arrow, then, using the CSS transform and transition I styled a smooth (ease-in-out) and (translateX) look alike swipe through the items in the movies list.
